# Research-Data-Camp-2024
## Hello there ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¤–
### Welcome to my first ever made repository
This repository is created in partial fulfillment of the requirements for Research Data Camp Microcredential.

The Research Data Camp aims to provide incoming and continuing graduate students with a gentle introduction to data and programming-related research tools that will increase their access to cutting-edge methods as they begin their programs and research. Topics covered include data management and data storage; tools for collaboration and sharing (using GitHub and GitHub Pages); data discovery; data ethics; data analysis and visualization fundamentals in Python and R; and an overview of data publishing and archiving.
